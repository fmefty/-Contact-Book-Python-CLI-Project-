Absolutely, Farhan! Here's a more detailed and polished version of the GitHub description with a richer explanation of the code logic and structure:

### ðŸ“’ Contact Book (Python CLI Project)

This is a beginner-friendly **command-line Contact Book** built using Python. It allows users to **store, search, update, and delete contacts** directly from the terminal.

---

### âœ… Features:

* **Add Contact** â€“ Store a name and phone number in memory
* **Search Contact** â€“ Look up contacts by name
* **Display Contacts** â€“ View all saved contacts neatly listed
* **Edit Contact** â€“ Update an existing contactâ€™s phone number
* **Delete Contact** â€“ Remove a contact after confirmation
* **Exit** â€“ Cleanly exit the program

---

### ðŸ§  How It Works:

* The program uses a Python **dictionary** (`Contact = {}`) where the key is the name and the value is the phone number.
* A function called `ShowFunction()` is used to print the contact list in a tabular format.
* The main program runs inside a `while True` loop, repeatedly displaying a numbered menu to the user.
* Based on the user's input (`choice`), it executes the appropriate block of code using `if-elif-else` statements.
* Input is taken using `input()`, and data is stored or modified in the dictionary accordingly.
* The program will continue running until the user selects **option 6** to exit.

### ðŸš€ Learning Objectives:

This project is great for learning:

* Working with **loops**, **conditionals**, and **functions**
* **Dictionaries** for key-value data storage
* Taking and validating **user input**
* Building a **menu-based CLI interface**
